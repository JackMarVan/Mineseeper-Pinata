# Pinata Minesweeper
A JavaFX project made in the Eclipse IDE recreating traditional Minesweeper with new rules.
Pinatas are added to the game which are like mines in every way, except they have a positive effect. Instead of ending the game, they reveal a random space. This aims to reduce the likelihood of truly luck-based situations per puzzle in an interesting way.
